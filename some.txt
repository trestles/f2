my thinking is this

"A merge unifies two or more commit history branches" G121

"Git computes a merge result and creates a new commit that represents the new, unified state" G121

remote branch - you push


merge strategies:
 1. degenerate merges G140


Normal Merges
1. Resolve 
2. Recursive - a simple criss-cross merge 
3. Octopus


Each of the merge strategies described in this chapter uses an underlying merge driver to resolve and merge each individual file G145
