my thinking is this

"Aborting or Restarting a Merge" G137

"The fast-forward case is particuarly common on tracking branches" G141

"the `non-fast-forward push problem`" G220

"A merge unifies two or more commit history branches" G121

"Git computes a merge result and creates a new commit that represents the new, unified state" G121

remote branch - you push
  git remote show origin


merge strategies:
 1. degenerate merges G140
