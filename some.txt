COMMITS:
"Heres what you must understand about the DAG of commits. First of all, each commit can have zero or more parents, as follow:
1. normal commits have exactly one parent, which is the previous commit in the history. When you make a change, your change is the difference between your new commit and its parent

2. there is usually only one commit wiht zero parents: the initial commit, which appears at the bottom of the graph

3. A merge commit which such as the one at the top of the graph, has more than one parent

refs and symrefs
a ref is an SHA1 hash ID that refers to an object within the Git object store G68

git reset --hard HEAD #G137

my thinking is this

"Aborting or Restarting a Merge" G137


Where is the other information?

"The fast-forward case is particuarly common on tracking branches" G141

"Your local tracking branch HEADs will always be fully present and represented because that is where the branch HEAD was after the `previous` fetch operation" G141

"the `non-fast-forward push problem`" G220

"A merge unifies two or more commit history branches" G121

"Git computes a merge result and creates a new commit that represents the new, unified state" G121

remote branch - you push
  git remote show origin


merge strategies:
 1. degenerate merges G140


Normal Merges
1. Resolve 
2. Recursive - a simple criss-cross merge 
3. Octopus


Each of the merge strategies described in this chapter uses an underlying merge driver to resolve and merge each individual file G145

Remotes:
git remote add origin /tmp/Depot/public_html # G206

"The command `git remote rm` removes the given remote and all of its associated remote-tracking branches from your local repository" G225

Where did everything go????

SHOW CONFIG INFO:
git config -l  # p226
