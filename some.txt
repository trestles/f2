git reset --hard HEAD #G137

my thinking is this

"Aborting or Restarting a Merge" G137


Where is the other information?

"The fast-forward case is particuarly common on tracking branches" G141

"Your local tracking branch HEADs will always be fully present and represented because that is where the branch HEAD was after the `previous` fetch operation" G141

"the `non-fast-forward push problem`" G220

"A merge unifies two or more commit history branches" G121

"Git computes a merge result and creates a new commit that represents the new, unified state" G121

remote branch - you push
  git remote show origin


merge strategies:
 1. degenerate merges G140


Normal Merges
1. Resolve 
2. Recursive - a simple criss-cross merge 
3. Octopus


Each of the merge strategies described in this chapter uses an underlying merge driver to resolve and merge each individual file G145

Remotes:
git remote add origin /tmp/Depot/public_html # G206
